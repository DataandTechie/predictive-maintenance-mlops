Predictive Maintenance MLOps

🔧 Project Overview

This project builds a low-scale, end-to-end MLOps pipeline to predict industrial equipment failures using time-series sensor data. The goal is to reduce unexpected downtimes and optimize maintenance schedules through data-driven insights.

🧠 Problem Statement

Many industries (manufacturing, energy, transportation) suffer from costly unplanned downtime. This project tackles this by implementing a machine learning pipeline for:
- Failure classification (predicting if failure will occur)
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL) regression

🎯 Goals

- Build and deploy an ML model for predictive maintenance
- Set up an MLOps workflow: versioning, CI/CD, monitoring, and retraining
- Design scalable architecture suitable for cloud deployment

🚀 Stack

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- MLflow (experiment tracking)
- Docker
- FastAPI or Flask (model serving)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Optional: Azure / AWS / GCP for cloud scaling

📁 Project Structure (Coming Soon)


📊 Data

We'll use publicly available or synthetic datasets:
- NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation dataset
- CMAPSS
- Others as needed

💡 Why this project?

- Real-world impact
- Strong business value (ROI-driven)
- MLOps friendly
- Cloud-deployable
